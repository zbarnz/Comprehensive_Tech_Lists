# Comprehensive Tech Lists ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Comprehensive Tech Lists** repository! This repository aims to provide curated lists of backend frameworks, frontend frameworks, document markup languages, programming languages, and popular libraries. The purpose of these lists is to offer developers, both seasoned and newcomers, a quick glance over the vast landscape of the tech world.

_Note: Esoteric languages have been deliberately excluded from these lists._

## Backend Frameworks

**What are they?** Backend frameworks are tools and libraries designed to support the development of a server-side application. They handle data validation, database interactions, authentication, and more, ensuring that data can be processed and transferred to the frontend.

## Frontend Frameworks

**What are they?** Frontend frameworks focus on the user interface and user experience. They provide pre-designed templates and components to create visually appealing web applications and ensure they work smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Document Markup Languages

**What are they?** Document markup languages define the structure and presentation of text. They use tags and annotations to denote different types of content, enabling rich document formatting and display, especially on the web.

- [List here](./lists/document_markup_languages.txt)

## Programming Languages

**What are they?** Programming languages are formal languages used to instruct computers. They follow a set of rules (syntax) and are used to develop software, websites, and various applications that run on digital devices.

- [List here](./lists/programming_languages.txt)

## Popular Libraries

**What are they?** Libraries are collections of pre-written code modules that developers can use to avoid repetitive tasks, thereby accelerating the development process. They can offer solutions for operations like network requests, date manipulations, or complex algorithms. 

_Note: A programming language does not need to be imperative or Turing-complete, but must be executable and so does not include markups such as HTML or XML, but does include domain-specific languages such as SQL and its dialects._
